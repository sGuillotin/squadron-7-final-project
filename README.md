## User feedback
At the time of our feedback, our prototype did not function and included the default MAUI interface color scheme. In response, we considered the following:
- Improved color/scheme logo to cohesive, in-house designs
- Tabbed layout
- Readable typeface/text that scales
- Frontend that links to backend successfully
- Consulting the rubric for the remainder of our backend design choices
